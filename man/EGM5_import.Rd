\usage{
EGM5_import(
  inputfile,
  date.format = "dmy",
  timezone = "UTC",
  save = FALSE,
  keep_all = FALSE,
  prec = c(3, 1, 500),
  proc.data.field = NULL
)

import.EGM5(
  inputfile,
  date.format = "dmy",
  timezone = "UTC",
  save = FALSE,
  keep_all = FALSE,
  prec = c(3, 1, 500),
  proc.data.field = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputfile}{character string; the name of a file with the extension .TXT}

\item{date.format}{character string; specifies the date format found in the
raw data file. Choose one of the following: "dmy", "ymd",
or "mdy". Default is "dmy", as it is the date format from
the example data file provided.}

\item{timezone}{character string; a time zone in which to import the data to
POSIXct format. Default is "UTC". Note about time zone: it is
recommended to use the time zone "UTC" to avoid any issue
related to summer time and winter time changes.}

\item{save}{logical; if \code{save = TRUE}, saves the file as an .RData file
in a RData folder in the current working directory. If
\code{save = FALSE}, returns the file in the Console, or load in
the Environment if assigned to an object.}

\item{keep_all}{logical; if \code{keep_all = TRUE}, keep all columns from the raw
file. The default is \code{keep_all = FALSE}, and columns that
are not necessary for gas flux calculation are removed.}

\item{prec}{numerical vector; the precision of the instrument for each gas,
in the following order: "CO2dry_ppm", "O2dry_pct" and "H2O_ppm".
The default is \code{prec = c(3, 1, 500)}.}

\item{proc.data.field}{numeric value; select the process data field used with
the EGM-5. There are 5 different modes available: (1)
Measure mode; (2) SRC or Custom mode; (3) CPY mode;
(4) Injection mode; or (5) Static mode. If no value
is specified, the parameters will be named "param1",
"param2", "param3", "param4" and "param5".}

\value{
A data frame containing raw data from the PP-Systems EGM-5 Portable
\ifelse{html}{\out{CO<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{CO[2]}{ASCII}} Gas Analyzer.

\description{
Imports single raw gas measurement files from the PP-Systems EGM-5 Portable
\ifelse{html}{\out{CO<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{CO[2]}{ASCII}} Gas Analyzer, with
the extension .TXT
}
\details{
In \code{date.format}, the date format refers to a date found in the raw data
file, not the date format in the file name. For the instrument EGM5, the date
is found in the column "Date".

Note that this function was designed for the following units in the raw file:
\itemize{
  \item ppm for \ifelse{html}{\out{CO<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{CO[2]}{ASCII}}
  \item \% for \ifelse{html}{\out{O<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{O[2]}{ASCII}} (pct)
  \item mb for \ifelse{html}{\out{H<sub>2</sub>O}}{\eqn{H[2]O}{ASCII}}
  \item mb for pressure
  \item Celsius for temperature}
If your PP-Systems EGM-5 uses different units, either convert the units after
import, change the settings on your instrument, or contact the maintainer of
this package for support.

Note that this instrument measures the "wet" fraction of
\ifelse{html}{\out{CO<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{CO[2]}{ASCII}} and
\ifelse{html}{\out{O<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{O[2]}{ASCII}}. If water vapor is
measured, the dry fraction of the gases is calculated automatically. If not,
it is important to measure the ambient water vapor concentration to convert
gases into their dry fraction and use those in the following steps of this
package. For example, \code{CO2dry_ppm = CO2wet_ppm/(1-H2O_ppm/1000000)}.

The precision of the instrument is needed to restrict kappa-max
(\code{\link[goFlux]{k.max}}) in the non-linear flux calculation
(\code{\link[goFlux]{HM.flux}}). Kappa-max is inversely proportional to
instrument precision. If the precision of your instrument is unknown, it is
better to use a low value (e.g. 1 ppm for
\ifelse{html}{\out{CO<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{CO[2]}{ASCII}} and
\ifelse{html}{\out{H<sub>2</sub>O}}{\eqn{H[2]O}{ASCII}}, or 1\% for
\ifelse{html}{\out{O<sub>2</sub>}}{\eqn{O[2]}{ASCII}}) to allow for more
curvature, especially for water vapor fluxes, or very long measurements, that
are normally curved. The default values given for instrument precision are
the ones provided by the manufacturer upon request, for the latest model of
this instrument available at the time of the creation of this function (11-2023).

at page 90 for more details about the different Process Data Fields
(\code{proc.data.field}).

Note that the default file extension for this instrument is .TXT, however,
it is also possible to use with a .csv file format.
